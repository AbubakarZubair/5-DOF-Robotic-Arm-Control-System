## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE (v1.8.0 or later)
- Basic understanding of Arduino programming
- Servo motor library (usually pre-installed)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robotic-arm-control.git
   cd robotic-arm-control
   ```

2. **Hardware Setup**
   - Connect servo motors to designated Arduino pins
   - Ensure proper power supply connections
   - Verify all connections match the pin configuration

3. **Software Upload**
   - Open `robotic_arm_control.ino` in Arduino IDE
   - Select correct board and port
   - Upload the code to Arduino Uno

4. **Testing**
   - Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud rate)
   - Send test commands to verify functionality

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Commands

The system accepts commands through the Serial Monitor:

```
// Individual joint control
moveJaw(angle);      // 0-75 degrees
moveWrist(angle);    // 0-125 degrees
moveElbow(angle);    // 0-180 degrees
moveBase(angle);     // 0-180 degrees
moveShoulder(angle); // 0-100 degrees

// Coordinated movements
pickObject();        // Automated pick sequence
placeObject();       // Automated place sequence
homePosition();      // Return to default position
```

### Operation Modes

1. **Manual Control**: Direct servo positioning via serial commands
2. **Automated Sequences**: Pre-programmed manipulation routines
3. **Coordinated Movement**: Multi-servo synchronized operations

## 🎯 Capabilities

### Manipulation Tasks
